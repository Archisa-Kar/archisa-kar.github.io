# Hi, I'm Archisa ðŸ‘‹

Here's a little ***summary*** of what I did for the lab!

- Created the 'Home' page

  - Basically, used HTML and CSS to create the layout for the homepage. 

- Used Jekyll

  - Created config.yml and then made the layouts directory to specify the common layout for all pages of the website.
  - Updated index.html, to use this layout.

- Created the 'Blog' page
  
  - Made the blog page using the basic layout.
  - Made a layout for all the blog posts to look _alike_!
  - Created a list on the HTML file of the blog to include the posts.

- Made the 'About' page from scratch

  - Created the About directory, and used the default layout for it.


And that ***SUMS*** it all up!
